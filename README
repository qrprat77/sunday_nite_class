This is a series of lessons taught by G. Brandon Hoyt in the summer of 2009. The class is held Sunday nites at Highlands Church of Christ in Lakeland, FL.  The presentations and questions follow a book by a fellow named Michael Green called _But_Don't_All_Religions_Lead_to_God?_ You can play along too!  It's a great lil' book, very easy to read, and it makes hard to understand concepts understandable.
